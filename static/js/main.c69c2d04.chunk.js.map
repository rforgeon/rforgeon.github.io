https://youtu.be/zEPCeXWQtyM)\n\nI became interested in 🔴Live when Meerkat (a video live streaming app) had [their explosive entrance onto the world stage](https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw).\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SXSW is moot. No one can learn about anything new because every conversation ends up being about Meerkat.</p>&mdash; Josh Constine (@JoshConstine) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshConstine/status/577273405952544768\">March 16, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nI set up a live squirrel cam on Meerkat. It included a motion sensor that tweeted every time squirrel motion was detected. The squirrel’s lure was a hanging ball of peanut butter.\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;Ostkaka Motion&#39; detected new motion: March 26, 2015 at 03:26PM <a href=\"http://t.co/DmMiCDEUUt\">pic.twitter.com/DmMiCDEUUt</a></p>&mdash; ralph (@rjforgeon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rjforgeon/status/581220774352162817\">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt was pretty cool, and squirrels came! I could watch them live once they arrived. I started spamming my friends’ emails with the “SQUIRREL IS LIVE” motion sensor event... however, the sensor started picking up shadows that moved every time the wind picked up.\n\nSQUIRREL\n\nSQUIRREL\n\nSQUIRREL\n\nNotifications kept coming.\n\nI was politely reminded by my friends that they were trying to work and to stop sending them emails.\n\nMy second interest in Live occurred when I learned of China’s live streaming craze. People were live streaming and receiving cold hard cash in the form of a digital teddy bear sticker that they called “digital gifts.” The trend intrigued me, although, aside from the few performers, comedians, and personalities, the majority of users were just creepy dudes throwing money at girls.\n\n![](https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/800/2016/1-chinaslivest.jpg)\n\n[The Economist's Take on China's Live Streaming](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21716461-new-way-bringing-colour-dreary-lives-chinas-new-craze-live-streaming)\n\n[Video with Chinese Live Streamers](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/live-streaming-in-china/)\n\nWhat I love about Live is it’s potential to be a two-way street for content consumption; viewers now have the ability to interact with the content creators AS THE CONTENT IS BEING CREATED.\n\nI started thinking of other ways to interact with Live.\n\nI added it to augmented reality….\n\n![](https://cldup.com/OMw0natu6c.jpg)\n\nAnd I connected it to hardware…\n\nFirst with [Russell Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russellkwilliams/), a brilliant mechanical engineer who makes awesome robots and architects' automated systems.\n\nHe created a “tug of war” light board and I added some chat functionality. While watching the light board on YouTube Live, you could control the lights when sending a command in the live chat.\n\nGoing further with this idea, how cool would it be if you were watching a live interview or late night show and you could do something to warrant a reaction from Jimmy Fallon?\n\nWhat if there was a water balloon above his head during the show and if 1 million people hit a button from the comfort of their own homes, that water balloon would pop on Fallon?...\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fx5HIlVDqhdfO/giphy.gif)\n\nI hired freelancer, [Mitchell B](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018e90fb3314781d22), and he developed a balloon popper. He did an outstanding job and you should definitely hire him if you’re looking to add some hardware to your projects.\n\nAfter first building my own simple chat bot, I found a more robust chatbot called [Nightbot](https://beta.nightbot.tv/) and connected it to my own custom Rails 5 API.\n\nNow when watching the balloon Live on YouTube, you can type \"!pop\" in the chat and move the needle towards the balloon. I’ve limited the command to only two \"!pop\" commands per viewer, so if you want to pop this balloon, you will need to recruit your friends.\n\n![](https://cldup.com/gSj1SNLoHO.png)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nMy next steps will most likely implement mass input art to some degree. I’m very inspired by [Pixel Place](http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/).\n\n\n![](https://i.redd.it/5p68ukzkwdpy.gif)\n\n\"Each pixel you see was placed by hand. Each icon, each flag, each meme created painstakingly by millions of people who had nothing in common except an Internet connection. Somehow, someway, what happened in Reddit over those 72 hours was the birth of Art.\" - [sudoscript](http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/)\n\nAlthough I really like the digital aspect of this, there are definitely some hardware aspects that could be translated here.\n\nIf you’re still wondering - I teared up because I’m passionate about 🔴Live, general technological advancement, and how our interactions morph and compliment these advancements. I couldn’t believe my eyes that these amazingly clear astronauts at this very moment were playing ping pong with water...in space...and I was witnessing it. I felt as if I was apart of it! That’s the power of 🔴Live.\n\n\n`\n\n\n\nexport default InteractiveLive;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport './posts.css'\n\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nconst ReactMarkdown = require('react-markdown/with-html')\n\n\nfunction FeatureBuild() {\n  return (\n\n        <div class=\"md-container\">\n        <div>\n        <ReactMarkdown\n          source={markdown}\n          escapeHtml={false}\n        />\n        </div>\n        </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\n\nconst markdown = `\n\n\n# Finimize Challenge\n\n## **Challenge:** Come up with a way for users to track progress towards their goals.\n\n\n## Outline\n1. Organizing Persona and Creating User [Job] Story.\n2. Wireframing\n3. Graphing & Sketch\n4. Discoveries and Alterations\n5. Framer Animation\n6. Next Steps\n\n## Organizing Persona and Creating User [Job] Story.\n\nOur persona is Jason, a 26 year old, male, consultant, from London. He makes a \"good\" salary and his financial level is intermediate. This means \"he’s never invested but he understands the basics of things and has been reading Finimize for some time.\"\n\nI've organized Josan into a User Story using As a..., When..., I Want..., So...\nBelow is a preview of the story, but click [here](https://airtable.com/shriib91ZPRXZPMLf/tblCpRmyH2pHx5oiI/viwkChBkmkV4NldO1) to view the full document.\n\n![](https://cldup.com/Ikl4oNQFvJ.png)\n\n## Wireframing\n\nAfter establishing what Jason's story might look like to track progress towards his goal, I began putting pen to paper. Bellow are a couple of my initial sketches. However, be sure to open the above 👆 Airtable User Story document to reference the sketches with each story line.\n\n![](https://cldup.com/-vFGBQebfu.png)\n\nWhile putting together some ideas, I immediately realized how useful [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) would be for this feature.\n\nI began playing around with the HighCharts API to see if something could be created in line with my initial wireframing. Check out the JsFiddle [here](http://jsfiddle.net/cwgeg9r3/).\n\n## Graphing & Sketch\n\nOnce I had an idea of how to layout the UI, I dove into Sketch. The starter template greatly helped to match Finimize's design.\n\nThis is where I brought together my wireframes, JsFiddle graph, and Finimize's design to show off a potential full package.\n\n![](https://cldup.com/WwnYCBZVi7.png)\n![](https://cldup.com/2Tmo5JuCBp.png)\n\n## Discoveries and Alterations\n\nWhile wireframing, I came to a discovery that allowed me to eliminate a step for the user in the tracking process.\n\nYou can see these steps in the \"Deprecated\" section of my AirTable User Story document.\n\nI first asked the user if they had made any new savings in one modal screen, then asking them to enter the savings amounts in a second screen.\n\nI decided to eliminate the first step and simply have the user click update with pre-filled ￡0 if they have not made any savings.\n\n![](https://cldup.com/65zFp-jKn6.png)\n\n## Framer Animation\n\nTo implement a more attractive input screen, I want to give the user a small feeling of reward for simply inputting a number. I do this by creating a wealth generation feeling in a coin collecting animation.\n\nI created this animation using [Framer](https://framer.com/) connected to Sketch.\n\n![](https://cldup.com/K2TecnNImq.gif)\n\nYou can interact with the animation [here](https://framer.cloud/ZUeZj/).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n### Feature Role Out\n\n🔴 Notification on the goal should allow for the majority of feature discovery and interaction. It also might be nice to have an Intercom notification of the visual tracking feature once a user hits the /goals page.\n\n### User Follow-Up On Feature\n\nOnce in the hands of users, these are questions I'd like to see answered:\n\n* When did you notice the feature? What did you think? Did you use it straight away?\n* What attracted you to it?\n* Were there any barriers to you using it?\n* Have you told anyone about it? What did you say?\n* What would you change to make this feature more enjoyable to use?\n\n`\n\n\n\nexport default FeatureBuild;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport './App.css';\nimport AboutMe from './stories/about-me';\nimport WorkingOn from './stories/working-on';\nimport Posts from './stories/posts';\n\nimport InteractiveLive from './posts/interactive-live';\nimport FeatureBuild from './posts/feature-build';\n\nimport Stories from 'react-insta-stories'\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n        <div>\n\n        <div class=\"title\">Ralph Forgeon</div>\n        <div class=\"social-icons\">\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/forgeon/\">\n            <img class=\"social-icon-item\" src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/forgeon.info/assets/icons8-linkedin-52.png\" />\n          </a>\n          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rjforgeon\">\n            <img class=\"social-icon-item\" src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/forgeon.info/assets/icons8-twitter-52.png\" />\n          </a>\n        </div>\n\n        <Router>\n\n        <div class=\"outer-div\">\n          <div class=\"flex-column-div\">\n\n\n        <div class=\"choose-story\">\n\n\n            <Link to=\"/\" style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color:'black' }}>\n              <div class=\"flex-column\">\n                <div >\n                  <img class=\"circle-img\" src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/forgeon.info/assets/about_square.jpg\"/>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"story-title\">\n                  About me\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </Link>\n\n            <Link to=\"/work\" style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color:'black' }}>\n              <div class=\"flex-column\">\n                <div >\n                  <img class=\"circle-img\" src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/forgeon.info/assets/working_on_square.jpg\"/>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"story-title\">\n                  Working on\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </Link>\n\n            <Link to='/posts' style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color:'black' }}>\n              <div class=\"flex-column\">\n                <div >\n                  <img class=\"circle-img\" src=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/forgeon.info/assets/posts_square.jpg\"/>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"story-title\">\n                  Posts\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </Link>\n        </div>\n\n        <Route path=\"/\" exact component={AboutMe} />\n        <Route path=\"/work/\" component={WorkingOn} />\n        <Route path=\"/posts/\" component={Posts} />\n\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <Route path=\"/interactive-live/\" component={InteractiveLive} />\n    <Route path=\"/feature-build/\" component={FeatureBuild} />\n\n    </Router>\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst stories = [\n  { url: 'https://picsum.photos/1080/1920',\n    seeMore: <p>Test </p>,\n    header: {\n      heading: 'Mohit Karekar',\n      subheading: 'Posted 5h ago',\n      profileImage: 'https://picsum.photos/1000/1000'\n    }\n  },\n  { url: 'https://fsa.zobj.net/crop.php?r=dyJ08vhfPsUL3UkJ2aFaLo1LK5lhjA_5o6qEmWe7CW6P4bdk5Se2tYqxc8M3tcgYCwKp0IAyf0cmw9yCmOviFYb5JteeZgYClrug_bvSGgQxKGEUjH9H3s7PS9fQa3rpK3DN3nx-qA-mf6XN',\n    header: {\n      heading: 'Mohit Karekar',\n      subheading: 'Posted 32m ago',\n      profileImage: 'https://picsum.photos/1080/1920'\n    }\n  },\n  { url: 'https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/iPhone-wallpaper-abstract-portrait-stars-macinmac.jpg',\n  header: {\n    heading: 'mohitk05/react-insta-stories',\n    subheading: 'Posted 32m ago',\n    profileImage: 'https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24852829?s=400&v=4'\n  }\n},\n{ url: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/coverr-main/mp4/Footboys.mp4',\n  type: 'video',\n  duration: 1000\n},\n{ url: 'http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ForBiggerJoyrides.mp4',\n  type: 'video',\n  seeMore: <p>Test </p>\n},\n{ url: 'http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ForBiggerBlazes.mp4',\n  type: 'video'\n},\n  'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534856966153-c86d43d53fe0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=564&q=80'\n]\n\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
